# BAMBARA
React web app for rock band Bambara's fans to come and collect their digital download of the purhcased 7" Night Chimes and also read a short story written by frontman, Reid Bateh. 

Within the 7" packaging is a card with a unique passage from the story printed on it. Certain words are highlighted and serve as the download code. Upon entering the site, the user will see the entire story with passages blocked out where codes have not been entered yet. Upon entering their code, the page scrolls to and reveals the unique passage with a highlighting animation and the download will start (with the exception of iOS devices, since direct file download is not supported, a disclaimer with instructions will show instead).
